# Complete App Design Reference

This folder contains the complete Figma design documentation for the EasyCo platform.

## Structure

### `/screenshots`
Visual reference of the complete application design from Figma.
- Organized by feature/section
- Provides the UX/UI source of truth for implementation

### `/figma-code`
Code generated by Figma AI for the complete application.
- Component structure references
- Styling patterns and suggestions
- May require adaptation to our Next.js/Supabase architecture

## Usage

When implementing new features:
1. Consult screenshots for visual accuracy
2. Reference figma-code for component structure ideas
3. Adapt to our existing architecture (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase)

## Note

This represents the **full vision** of the EasyCo platform. Implementation will be done in phases:
- Phase 1 (Current): Onboarding flows - validation of segmentation
- Phase 2 (Next): Core MVP features based on validation results
- Phase 3+: Advanced features and enhancements
