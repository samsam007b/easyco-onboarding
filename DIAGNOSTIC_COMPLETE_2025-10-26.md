# EasyCo Onboarding - Complete Diagnostic Report
**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Session:** Post-Resident Role Implementation

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive diagnostic performed on the EasyCo onboarding platform after implementing the Resident role and dependent profiles feature. This report documents all bugs found, fixes applied, and current system status.

---

## ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Profile-Type Integration

### Issue Identified
The profile-type page (`/onboarding/searcher/profile-type`) was created to ask "Who are you searching for?" (self vs. dependent) but was **not integrated** into the Searcher onboarding flow. New Searchers were skipping this critical question entirely.

### Impact
- Dependent profiles feature was completely non-functional
- Parents couldn't create separate profiles for their children
- All Searchers bypassed the profile-type selection

### Root Cause
6 redirect locations throughout the codebase were pointing directly to `/onboarding/searcher/basic-info` instead of starting at `/onboarding/searcher/profile-type`.

### Files Fixed
1. **app/dashboard/searcher/page.tsx:68** - Dashboard redirect for incomplete onboarding
2. **app/auth/complete-signup/page.tsx:46-50** - OAuth callback redirect logic
3. **app/profile/page.tsx:191-196** - Role switching redirect
4. **app/profile/page.tsx:227-232** - Onboarding reset redirect
5. **app/select-user-type/page.tsx:49-54** - User type selection redirect #1
6. **app/select-user-type/page.tsx:98-102** - User type selection redirect #2

### Solution Applied
All Searcher onboarding entry points now correctly redirect to `/onboarding/searcher/profile-type` as the first step. Owner and Resident roles continue to start at `basic-info`.

```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
router.push(`/onboarding/${pendingUserType}/basic-info`)

// After (CORRECT)
if (pendingUserType === 'searcher') {
  router.push('/onboarding/searcher/profile-type')
} else {
  router.push(`/onboarding/${pendingUserType}/basic-info`)
}
```

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

### Three-Role Architecture ✅ COMPLETE

All three roles are fully implemented with complete onboarding flows:

#### 1. Searcher Role
- **Onboarding Flow:** 14 pages (profile-type → basic-info → ... → success)
- **Core Pages:** 6 (profile-type, basic-info, preferences, lifestyle, social-vibe, home-lifestyle)
- **Additional Pages:** 7 (ideal-coliving, daily-habits, privacy, verification, review)
- **Dashboard:** Full dashboard with profile completion bar (20 fields tracked)
- **Profile Type Feature:** ✅ NOW INTEGRATED (asks if searching for self or dependent)

## 🐛 BUGS REMAINING / KNOWN ISSUES

### 1. ⚠️ Dependent Profiles Feature - INCOMPLETE

**Status:** Only UI created, not functional

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Profile-type selection page (`/onboarding/searcher/profile-type`)
- ✅ UI asking "Who are you searching for?" (For Myself | For Someone Else)
- ✅ Visual card-based design with icons
- ✅ Saves selection to localStorage as `searcherProfileType`
- ✅ NOW properly integrated into onboarding flow

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Database schema for multiple profiles per user
- ❌ Relationship field in basic-info (parent/child/friend)
- ❌ Profile name field for dependents ("Profile for: Emma")
- ❌ Profile switcher in dashboard
- ❌ Profile management interface (view/edit/delete dependent profiles)
- ❌ Logic to handle multiple `user_profiles` rows per user or JSON metadata

**Impact:**
- Parents can select "For Someone Else" but can't actually create separate profiles
- Feature is 20% complete (UI only, no backend logic)

**Recommended Solution:**
Either (A) Add `parent_profile_id` column to link dependent profiles, or (B) Use JSONB `metadata` column to store multiple profile configurations.

### 2. ⚠️ Background Dev Servers

**Issue:** 8 background `npm run dev` processes are running and won't terminate

**Shell IDs:**
- 83722d, c8bc65, b4db53, 95f3ce, db2d05, 584c57, e13dc2, 32a0b4

**Attempted Fixes:**
- `pkill -9 node` - Failed
- `pkill -9 -f "npm run dev"` - Failed
- Individual `KillShell` commands - Failed

**Impact:** Low - doesn't block development, but wastes system resources

**Recommendation:** Restart the system or manually kill processes via Activity Monitor/Task Manager

### 3. ℹ️ Vercel Deployment Limit

**Status:** Temporarily hit 100 deployments/day limit on free tier

**Impact:** Cannot deploy to production until limit resets

**Solution:** Wait for daily limit reset or upgrade to paid plan
