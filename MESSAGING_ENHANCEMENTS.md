# Messaging System Enhancements

## 📅 Date: October 28, 2025

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema Enhancements** (Migration 027)

#### File Attachments Support
- `attachment_url` - URL to file in Supabase Storage
- `attachment_type` - MIME type (image/jpeg, application/pdf, etc.)
- `attachment_size` - File size in bytes
- `attachment_name` - Original filename
- `message_type` - text, image, file, or system

#### Message Reactions
- New table `message_reactions`
- Users can react with emojis to messages
- One reaction per user per emoji per message
- Full RLS policies for security

#### Typing Indicators
- New table `typing_indicators`
- Real-time typing status via Supabase Broadcast
- Auto-cleanup of old indicators (>10 seconds)
- Optimized for real-time performance

#### Automatic Read Receipts
- Trigger `mark_messages_as_read()` automatically marks messages as read
- Updates `read_at` timestamp when conversation_read_status is updated
- No manual intervention needed

### 2. **File Upload System**

#### lib/messaging/file-upload.ts
Complete file upload utility with:
- ✅ File validation (type, size)
- ✅ Supabase Storage integration
- ✅ Unique filename generation
- ✅ Public URL retrieval
- ✅ File deletion support
- ✅ Helper functions (formatFileSize, isImageFile, etc.)

**Supported File Types:**
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- **Max size**: 10MB

**Storage Bucket**: `message-attachments`

### 3. **Typing Indicator Hook**

#### lib/hooks/use-typing-indicator.ts
Real-time typing indicators with:
- ✅ Supabase Broadcast for instant updates
- ✅ Auto-stop typing after 3 seconds of inactivity
- ✅ Multiple users typing support
- ✅ Formatted text helper (`getTypingText`)
- ✅ Database persistence (optional)

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { typingUsers, startTyping, stopTyping, isAnyoneTyping } = useTypingIndicator(
  conversationId,
  userId
)

// When user types
startTyping(userName)

// Auto-stops after 3 seconds or manually:
stopTyping(userName)
```

### 4. **Enhanced use-messages Hook**

#### Updates to lib/hooks/use-messages.ts
- ✅ Extended `Message` interface with attachment fields
- ✅ New function: `sendMessageWithAttachment()`
- ✅ Support for image and file message types
- ✅ Automatic message type detection

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { sendMessageWithAttachment } = useMessages(userId)

// Upload file first
const uploadResult = await uploadMessageAttachment(file, conversationId, userId)

// Send message with attachment
if (uploadResult.success) {
  await sendMessageWithAttachment(
    conversationId,
    "Check this out!", // Optional caption
    uploadResult.url!,
    uploadResult.fileType!,
    uploadResult.fileSize!,
    uploadResult.fileName!
  )
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps for Implementation

### **CRITICAL: Create Storage Bucket**

You MUST create the storage bucket in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project
2. Click **Storage** in left sidebar
3. Click **New bucket**
4. Bucket name: `message-attachments`
5. **Public bucket**: ❌ NO (keep private)
6. Click **Create bucket**

### **Configure Storage Policies**

After creating the bucket, add these policies in Supabase Dashboard:

**Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload message attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'message-attachments'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]
);
```

**Policy 2: Allow users to read attachments in their conversations**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view attachments in own conversations"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'message-attachments'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.conversations c
    WHERE c.id::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
    AND (c.participant1_id = auth.uid() OR c.participant2_id = auth.uid())
  )
);
```

**Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own uploads**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'message-attachments'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]
);
```

### **Apply Migration 027**

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy content from supabase/migrations/027_enhance_messaging_system.sql
-- And execute
```

## 📊 Feature Comparison

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Text messages | ✅ | ✅ |
| Read receipts | ❌ | ✅ Automatic |
| Typing indicators | ❌ | ✅ Real-time |
| Image uploads | ❌ | ✅ |
| Document uploads | ❌ | ✅ |
| Message reactions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Real-time updates | ✅ | ✅ Enhanced |

## 🎨 UI Components to Create

To use these new features, you'll need to create UI components:

### 1. **FileUploadButton Component**
- File picker with drag & drop
- Preview before sending
- Progress bar during upload
- Error handling UI

### 2. **MessageBubble Component Updates**
- Display attached images inline
- File attachment cards with download button
- "Read at HH:MM" indicator
- Reaction picker UI

### 3. **TypingIndicator Component**
- Animated dots "..."
- Display "User is typing..."
- Show multiple users typing

### 4. **ChatInput Component Updates**
- File attachment button
- Send typing indicators on input change
- Stop typing on send or after 3 seconds

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ All tables have Row Level Security enabled
- ✅ Users can only access messages in their own conversations
- ✅ File uploads are scoped to conversation folders
- ✅ Attachment URLs are private (require authentication)
- ✅ File size limits prevent abuse (10MB max)
- ✅ File type validation on both client and server

---

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Indexes on attachment_url, message_id, conversation_id
- ✅ Typing indicators auto-cleanup (no database bloat)
- ✅ Broadcast instead of database polls for typing
- ✅ Efficient read receipt marking via trigger

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No message editing yet** - `edited_at` column exists but not implemented
2. **No message deletion** - `deleted_at` column exists but not implemented
3. **No voice messages** - Can be added later
4. **No message search** - Would require full-text index on content
5. **No read receipts for individual messages in UI** - Backend ready, UI needed

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create storage bucket and policies** (5 minutes)
2. **Apply migration 027** (1 minute)
3. **Test file upload in console** (5 minutes)
4. **Build UI components** (2-3 hours)
5. **Test end-to-end** (30 minutes)
6. **Deploy to production** (5 minutes)
