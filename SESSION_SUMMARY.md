# Development Session Summary

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Session**: Continuation - Application System Implementation

## Overview

This session continued from a previous conversation and focused on completing the property application system for the EasyCo coliving platform. The system allows searchers to apply for properties and owners to review and manage those applications.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Application System Backend & Logic

#### Database Schema ([supabase/migrations/016_create_applications_table.sql](supabase/migrations/016_create_applications_table.sql))
- **Applications table** with comprehensive workflow
  - Status: `pending` → `reviewing` → `approved`/`rejected`/`withdrawn`/`expired`
  - Fields: move-in date, lease duration, personal info, professional info, message
  - Unique constraint: one application per user per property

- **Database Functions**:
  - `notify_new_application()` - Auto-notify owners of new applications
  - `notify_application_status_change()` - Auto-notify applicants of status changes
  - `get_property_application_count()` - Get application stats for properties

- **RLS Policies** for secure multi-tenant access
- **Indexes** on frequently queried columns

#### Application Hook ([lib/hooks/use-applications.ts](lib/hooks/use-applications.ts))
Custom React hook for application management:
- `createApplication()` - Submit new application
- `loadApplications(asOwner)` - Load applications (owner or applicant view)
- `hasApplied(propertyId)` - Check if user already applied
- `updateApplicationStatus()` - Owner review actions (approve/reject/mark reviewing)
- `withdrawApplication()` - Applicant can withdraw pending applications
- `deleteApplication()` - Remove from history
- `getApplicationStats()` - Statistics for dashboards

---

#### Application Modal ([components/ApplicationModal.tsx](components/ApplicationModal.tsx))
Comprehensive application form modal:
- **4 Sections**:
  1. Personal Information (name, email, phone)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Application System                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

User Action:
  Searcher clicks "Apply Now" → ApplicationModal opens
         ↓
  User fills form → createApplication() called
         ↓
  Supabase: INSERT into applications table
         ↓
  Database Trigger: notify_new_application() fires
         ↓
  Notification created for property owner
         ↓
  Owner notification badge updates (real-time)

Owner Action:
  Owner clicks "Approve" → updateApplicationStatus() called
         ↓
  Supabase: UPDATE applications SET status = 'approved'
         ↓
  Database Trigger: notify_application_status_change() fires
         ↓
  Notification created for applicant
         ↓
  Applicant notification badge updates (real-time)
```

### Real-time Features

1. **Application Notifications**
   - Database triggers automatically create notifications
   - Supabase Realtime pushes to notification hook
   - Badge updates immediately without page refresh

2. **Status Updates**
   - Owner actions trigger status change
   - Applicant sees updates in real-time
   - Toast notifications provide immediate feedback
