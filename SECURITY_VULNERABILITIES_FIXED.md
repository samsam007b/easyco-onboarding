# Security Vulnerabilities - Summary Report

## Executive Summary

Two critical security vulnerabilities were identified by Supabase's security linter related to `SECURITY DEFINER` views that bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Status**:
- ✅ Fix #1 Applied
- ⚠️ Fix #2 Ready to Apply

---

## Vulnerability #1: v_platform_metrics (RESOLVED ✅)

### Risk Level
**HIGH** - Exposes platform-wide aggregated statistics to unauthorized users

### What Was Exposed
- Total counts of active searchers, owners, residents
- Platform onboarding completion rates
- Average profile completion scores
- KYC verification statistics

### Fix Applied
Replaced view with admin-only function that:
- Explicitly checks if caller is an admin
- Uses `SECURITY INVOKER` (runs with caller's privileges)
- Fails with clear error for non-admins

### Files
- Migration: [supabase/migrations/034_fix_platform_metrics_security.sql](supabase/migrations/034_fix_platform_metrics_security.sql)
- Applied: [supabase/APPLY_SECURITY_FIX.sql](supabase/APPLY_SECURITY_FIX.sql) ✅

---

## Vulnerability #2: v_complete_user_profiles (NEEDS APPLICATION ⚠️)

### Risk Level
**CRITICAL** - Exposes all users' complete personal information

### What Is Currently Exposed
When this view runs with `SECURITY DEFINER`, any authenticated user can see:
- ✗ All users' full names, dates of birth, nationalities
- ✗ KYC documents and verification status
- ✗ Banking information (IBAN, BIC/SWIFT, account holder)
- ✗ Income brackets and employment details
- ✗ Personal preferences and lifestyle data
- ✗ Privacy consents and settings
- ✗ Contact information

### Fix Ready to Apply
Remove `SECURITY DEFINER` so RLS policies properly restrict each user to see only their own data.

### Files Created
- Migration: [supabase/migrations/035_fix_complete_user_profiles_security.sql](supabase/migrations/035_fix_complete_user_profiles_security.sql)
- Standalone SQL: [supabase/APPLY_COMPLETE_PROFILES_FIX.sql](supabase/APPLY_COMPLETE_PROFILES_FIX.sql) ⚠️ **APPLY THIS NOW**

---

## How to Apply Fix #2 (URGENT)

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Immediate - Recommended)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of [supabase/APPLY_COMPLETE_PROFILES_FIX.sql](supabase/APPLY_COMPLETE_PROFILES_FIX.sql)
4. Paste and Run
5. Verify with the included test queries

**Time required**: 2 minutes

### Method 2: CLI (when migration conflicts are resolved)

```bash
supabase db push
```

## Technical Details

### What is SECURITY DEFINER?

Views with `SECURITY DEFINER` run with the privileges of the **view creator** instead of the **current user**. This:
- Bypasses all Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Grants access based on creator's permissions, not caller's
- Creates privilege escalation vulnerabilities

### Why Our Views Were Vulnerable

Our application uses RLS policies like:

```sql
-- Users should only see their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data"
  ON public.users FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

But when a view has `SECURITY DEFINER`, these policies are **ignored**, allowing:
- User A to see User B's profile
- User C to see User D's verification documents
- Any user to see all other users' data

### The Fix Strategy

**For admin-only data** (platform_metrics):
- Replace view with `SECURITY INVOKER` function
- Add explicit admin checks
- Fail fast for non-admins

**For user-scoped data** (complete_user_profiles):
- Simply remove `SECURITY DEFINER`
- Let existing RLS policies handle access control
- Each user naturally sees only their own data

---

## Verification

### After Applying Fix #2

Run these tests in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Test 1: View exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_name = 'v_complete_user_profiles';
-- Expected: 1

-- Test 2: RLS is enabled on underlying tables
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('users', 'user_profiles', 'user_verifications', 'user_consents');
-- Expected: All should show rowsecurity = true

-- Test 3: As authenticated user, query should only return YOUR data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_complete_user_profiles;
-- Expected: 1 (your profile only, not all users)
```

## Compliance & Privacy Impact

### Before Fixes
- ❌ GDPR violation (unauthorized data access)
- ❌ Privacy breach (cross-user data exposure)
- ❌ Compliance risk (failed access controls)
- ❌ Audit findings (RLS bypass)

### After Fixes
- ✅ GDPR compliant (data isolation per user)
- ✅ Privacy protected (RLS enforced)
- ✅ Access controls functional
- ✅ Audit-ready architecture

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ⚠️ **Apply Fix #2** using [APPLY_COMPLETE_PROFILES_FIX.sql](supabase/APPLY_COMPLETE_PROFILES_FIX.sql)
2. ✅ Run verification queries
3. ✅ Test with multiple user accounts

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Resolve migration conflicts preventing `supabase db push`
2. Document any application code using these views
3. Add monitoring for similar security issues

### Long Term (This Month)
1. Regular security audits using Supabase linter
2. Add CI/CD checks for `SECURITY DEFINER` usage
3. Review all functions and views for security issues
4. Implement automated RLS testing
