# Matching System - EasyCo Platform

## üìÖ Date: October 28, 2025 - 03:40 AM

## üéØ Overview

The matching system intelligently connects searchers with compatible properties and owners based on multiple factors including budget, location, lifestyle preferences, and availability.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** (Migration 028)

#### Tables Created:

**`matches`** - Core matching table
- `searcher_id` - Searcher being matched
- `owner_id` - Owner/property being matched to
- `property_id` - Specific property (nullable for now)
- **Score Breakdown** (totals 100 points):
  - `budget_score` (0-30) - Budget compatibility
  - `location_score` (0-25) - Geographic proximity
  - `lifestyle_score` (0-20) - Lifestyle compatibility
  - `availability_score` (0-15) - Move-in date alignment
  - `preferences_score` (0-10) - Values and preferences match
- `status` - active, viewed, contacted, hidden, expired
- `viewed_at`, `contacted_at`, `hidden_at` - Interaction timestamps
- `match_reason` - Human-readable explanation
- `expires_at` - Auto-expires after 30 days

**`match_notifications`** - Notification system
- `user_id` - Recipient
- `match_id` - Related match
- `notification_type` - new_match, match_viewed, match_contacted
- `title`, `message` - Notification content
- `sent_at`, `read_at`, `clicked_at` - Tracking

**`match_feedback`** - Algorithm improvement
- `match_id` - Match being rated
- `user_id` - User providing feedback
- `rating` (1-5) - Match quality rating
- `helpful` (boolean) - Was this match helpful?
- `feedback_text` - Optional comments

#### Functions Created:

**`calculate_match_score(searcher_id, owner_id, property_id)`**
- Calculates comprehensive match score
- Returns score breakdown and match reason
- Considers:
  - Budget alignment
  - Location proximity (city matching)
  - Lifestyle compatibility (smoking, pets, sociability)
  - Core values overlap
  - Deal breakers avoidance
- Returns human-readable match reasoning

**`expire_old_matches()`**
- Auto-expires matches older than 30 days
- Should be called via cron job daily

**`mark_match_viewed(match_id, user_id)`**
- Marks a match as viewed
- Updates status from 'active' to 'viewed'
- Tracks when user saw the match

## üìä Scoring Algorithm

### Total Score: 100 points

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Budget** | 30% | Searcher's budget vs property price |
| **Location** | 25% | City matching, neighborhood proximity |
| **Lifestyle** | 20% | Smoking, pets, sociability, cleanliness |
| **Availability** | 15% | Move-in date vs property availability |
| **Preferences** | 10% | Core values, important qualities, deal breakers |

### Score Interpretation

- **90-100**: Excellent match (highly recommended)
- **75-89**: Very good match (recommended)
- **60-74**: Good match (worth considering)
- **45-59**: Fair match (some compatibility issues)
- **0-44**: Poor match (many incompatibilities)

---

## üîí Security (RLS Policies)

‚úÖ **Matches Table**:
- Searchers can view their own matches
- Owners can view matches for their properties
- System (service role) can insert matches
- Users can update their own matches (status, timestamps)

‚úÖ **Notifications Table**:
- Users can view their own notifications
- System can insert notifications
- Users can update (mark as read)

‚úÖ **Feedback Table**:
- Users can view/insert/update feedback for their matches
- Feedback is scoped to match participants

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Match Generation** (Backend/Cron)

```typescript
// Pseudocode for match generation
async function generateMatches() {
  // Get all active searchers with completed profiles
  const searchers = await getActiveSearchers()

  // Get all active owners/properties
  const owners = await getActiveOwners()

  for (const searcher of searchers) {
    for (const owner of owners) {
      // Calculate match score
      const score = await calculateMatchScore(searcher.id, owner.id)

      // Only create matches above threshold (e.g., 60%)
      if (score.total_score >= 60) {
        await createMatch({
          searcher_id: searcher.id,
          owner_id: owner.id,
          ...score
        })

        // Send notification
        await sendMatchNotification(searcher.id, match.id)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **User Views Matches** (Frontend)

```typescript
// Get matches for logged-in searcher
const { data: matches } = await supabase
  .from('matches')
  .select(`
    *,
    owner:users!owner_id(full_name, avatar_url),
    property:properties(*)
  `)
  .eq('searcher_id', userId)
  .eq('status', 'active')
  .order('total_score', { ascending: false })
  .limit(20)
```

### 3. **Mark as Viewed**

```typescript
// When user clicks on a match
await supabase.rpc('mark_match_viewed', {
  p_match_id: matchId,
  p_user_id: userId
})
```

### 4. **Contact Owner**

```typescript
// When user wants to contact
await supabase
  .from('matches')
  .update({
    status: 'contacted',
    contacted_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', matchId)

// Then navigate to messaging
router.push(`/messages?conversation=${ownerId}`)
```

## üì± UI Components Needed

### 1. **Match Card Component**
```tsx
<MatchCard
  match={match}
  owner={owner}
  property={property}
  onView={() => markViewed(match.id)}
  onContact={() => contactOwner(match.id)}
  onHide={() => hideMatch(match.id)}
/>
```

**Displays:**
- Match score percentage with color coding
- Owner/property photo
- Key compatibility factors
- "Why this match?" explanation
- Action buttons (View, Contact, Hide)

### 2. **Matches Dashboard**
```tsx
<MatchesDashboard>
  <MatchFilters /> {/* Filter by score, location, etc. */}
  <MatchSort /> {/* Sort by score, date, etc. */}
  <MatchList>
    {matches.map(match => <MatchCard key={match.id} {...match} />)}
  </MatchList>
</MatchesDashboard>
```

### 3. **Match Detail Page**
- Full breakdown of scores
- Detailed compatibility analysis
- Property photos and details
- Owner profile summary
- Contact button
- Feedback form

## üîÑ Maintenance Tasks

### Daily Cron Job
```sql
-- Run every day at 2 AM
SELECT expire_old_matches();
```

### Weekly Match Generation
```sql
-- Generate new matches for all users
-- This would be a custom function or API endpoint
-- that calls calculate_match_score() for all combinations
```

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Next Week):
1. **ML-Based Scoring** - Use past interactions to improve algorithm
2. **Collaborative Filtering** - "Users like you also matched with..."
3. **Dynamic Score Weights** - Personalize weights based on user behavior
4. **Geographic Distance** - Use exact coordinates instead of city matching
5. **Availability Calendar** - Real-time property availability integration

### Phase 3 (Later):
1. **Group Matching** - Match groups of searchers with multi-room properties
2. **Bi-directional Matching** - Owners can also see compatible searchers
3. **Match Explanations** - Detailed AI-generated compatibility reports
4. **Match Preferences** - Let users prioritize what matters most to them
5. **Re-matching** - Suggest new matches when old ones expire

## üìä Analytics to Track

- **Match Quality**:
  - Average match score
  - Distribution of scores
  - Matches by score range

- **User Engagement**:
  - % of matches viewed
  - % of matches contacted
  - % of matches hidden
  - Average time to view
  - Average time to contact

- **Algorithm Performance**:
  - Feedback ratings by score range
  - Helpful vs not helpful ratio
  - Score accuracy (do high scores lead to contacts?)

- **Business Metrics**:
  - Matches leading to conversations
  - Matches leading to applications
  - Matches leading to leases

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):
1. ‚úÖ Apply migration 028
2. ‚è≥ Create API endpoint `/api/matches/generate`
3. ‚è≥ Create API endpoint `/api/matches/for-user`
4. ‚è≥ Build Match Card component
5. ‚è≥ Build Matches Dashboard
6. ‚è≥ Add "Matches" nav item to searcher dashboard

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Threshold Matters**: Only show matches above 60% to maintain quality
2. **Freshness**: Expire old matches to encourage active use
3. **Transparency**: Show users WHY they matched (build trust)
4. **Feedback Loop**: Collect feedback to improve algorithm
5. **Privacy**: RLS ensures users only see their own matches
