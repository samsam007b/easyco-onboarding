# Group Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented complete group functionality allowing searchers to search for properties alone, create groups, or join existing groups. Groups can apply for properties together and share aggregated preferences.

## Database Schema

### Migration File
Location: `supabase/migrations/017_create_groups_tables.sql`

### Tables Created

#### 1. `groups`
- Stores group information
- Fields: name, description, max_members, is_open, requires_approval
- Aggregated preferences: budget_min, budget_max, preferred_cities, move_in_date
- Auto-updates preferences based on member profiles

#### 2. `group_members`
- Tracks members of each group
- Roles: creator, admin, member
- Status: pending, active, left, removed
- One creator per group, multiple admins possible

#### 3. `group_invitations`
- Supports two invitation methods:
  - Direct invitation by email (invited_user_id)
  - Shareable invite code (invite_code)
- Status: pending, accepted, declined, expired
- Includes expiration dates for codes

#### 4. `group_applications`
- Groups apply for properties together
- Status: pending, reviewing, approved, rejected, withdrawn
- Includes combined_income field
- Property owners can review and respond

### Key Functions

1. **get_group_member_count(group_uuid)** - Returns active member count
2. **is_user_in_group(user_uuid, group_uuid)** - Checks membership
3. **generate_invite_code()** - Generates unique 8-character codes
4. **update_group_preferences(group_uuid)** - Aggregates member preferences

### Triggers

- Auto-update group preferences when members change
- Auto-update timestamps
- Notify members when someone joins
- Notify users when invited to groups

## Frontend Implementation

### Pre-Onboarding Flow

  2. Create a Group - Navigate to group creation
  3. Join a Group - Navigate to join page
- Beautiful card-based UI with icons and descriptions
- Selection stored in localStorage

#### Create Group Page
**File:** `app/onboarding/searcher/create-group/page.tsx`
- Group name (required, max 100 chars)
- Description (optional, max 500 chars)
- Max members (2-10, default 4)
- Requires approval checkbox (default true)
- Creates group and adds creator as first member

  2. **Invite Code** - Enter 8-character code
- Displays group information before joining
- Shows member count and availability
- Handles approval requirements

## Database Migration Instructions

Since you're using a remote Supabase instance, apply the migration manually:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase/migrations/017_create_groups_tables.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Run the migration
6. Verify all 4 tables were created successfully

Alternatively, if you have Supabase CLI connected to remote:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

## Known Limitations

1. **One Group Per User:** Currently users can only be in one active group at a time
2. **Creator Cannot Leave:** Creator must transfer ownership or delete group
3. **No Group Discovery:** Users need invite codes, no public group browsing yet
4. **No Group Applications UI:** Backend ready but frontend pending
5. **No Group Preferences Edit:** Only auto-calculated from members

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration** - Run SQL in Supabase dashboard
2. **Test End-to-End** - Complete flow from selection to dashboard
3. **Group Applications UI** - Allow groups to apply for properties
4. **Property Listings Integration** - Show "Apply as Group" option
5. **Group Discovery** - Public group search/browse feature
6. **Enhanced Notifications** - More detailed group activity notifications

## Notes

- Users can change mode later from dashboard
- Group preferences update automatically when members join/leave
- All group actions are tracked and auditable
- Notification system already integrated
- Ready for group-based matching algorithm
