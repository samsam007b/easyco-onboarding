# Diagnostic Report - Site Loading Issues

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Issue**: Site not loading on Vercel (infinite loading / network connection errors)

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. SSR Hydration Errors - **CRITICAL** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Multiple components were accessing `localStorage` and `document` during Server-Side Rendering (SSR), causing hydration mismatches between server and client.

**Files Affected**:
- `lib/i18n/use-language.ts`
- `lib/role/role-context.tsx`
- `components/CookieBanner.tsx`

**Symptoms**:
- "Failed to load resource: La connexion réseau a été perdue"
- Site hangs indefinitely
- Blank white screen

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
useEffect(() => {
  const savedRole = localStorage.getItem('activeRole');
  // ...
}, []);

// AFTER (FIXED):
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const savedRole = localStorage.getItem('activeRole');
    // ...
  }
}, []);
```

### 2. Document Access During SSR ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: RoleProvider was accessing `document.body` during SSR.

**Fix**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    if (activeRole) {
      document.body.className = roleConfigs[activeRole].themeClass;
    }
  }
}, [activeRole]);
```

## Changes Made

### Commits:
1. `a81f7d4` - fix: prevent localStorage access during SSR in LanguageProvider
2. `5dfb42a` - fix: prevent SSR errors in RoleProvider and CookieBanner

### Files Modified:
1. **lib/i18n/use-language.ts**
   - Added `typeof window` checks in useEffect (line 22)
   - Added `typeof window` checks in setLanguage (line 32)
   - Added mounted state to prevent hydration mismatch

2. **lib/role/role-context.tsx**
   - Added `typeof window` checks in useEffect (line 89)
   - Added `typeof window` checks in setActiveRole (line 100)
   - Added `typeof window` checks before document.body access (line 117)

3. **components/CookieBanner.tsx**
   - Added `typeof window` checks in useEffect (line 15)
   - Added `typeof window` checks in acceptCookies (line 28)
   - Added `typeof window` checks in declineCookies (line 36)

## Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Initial Error Analysis
- Error: "Failed to load resource: network connection lost"
- Vercel build succeeded (88 pages compiled)
- Deployment succeeded
- Site didn't load in browser

### Step 2: Code Review
- Searched for all `localStorage` usage (39 files found)
- Identified components loaded in root layout
- Found 3 critical files with SSR issues

### Step 3: Root Cause
- Components in `ClientProviders` were accessing browser APIs during SSR
- `LanguageProvider`, `RoleProvider` were called on every page
- `CookieBanner` was also in root layout

### Step 4: Fix Applied
- Added `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks
- Added mounted state where needed
- Protected all localStorage and document access

## Testing

### Local Build:
- Local build fails due to missing SWC binary (local environment issue only)
- Not a problem for Vercel deployment

### Vercel Deployment:
- ✅ Commits pushed successfully
- ✅ Vercel auto-deploy triggered
- ⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Wait for Vercel deployment to complete (~2 minutes)
2. ⏳ Test site loads at https://easyco-onboarding-kappa.vercel.app
3. ⏳ Verify all pages load correctly
4. ⏳ Test user flows (signup, login, onboarding)

## Additional Notes

### Files That Use localStorage (Safe)
These files are already safe because they're used in page components (client-side only):
- All onboarding pages
- Dashboard pages
- Profile pages
- Auth callback routes

### Files That Need Monitoring
If future issues arise, check:
- `components/ResumeOnboardingModal.tsx` (already has SSR checks)
- `lib/hooks/use-auto-save.ts` (already has SSR checks)
- Any new components added to `app/layout.tsx`

## Prevention Guidelines

**For Future Development**:
1. Always use `typeof window !== 'undefined'` before accessing:
   - `localStorage`
   - `sessionStorage`
   - `document`
   - `navigator`
   - `window` object

2. Components in `app/layout.tsx` must be SSR-safe
3. Use `'use client'` directive for client-only components
4. Test builds locally before deploying

## Status

**Current Status**: ✅ FIXES DEPLOYED
**Deployment**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Site Status**: ⏳ PENDING VERIFICATION
